## üìã Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Complete AI16Z Integration**:
   - Test AI-powered analysis with various content types
   - Add AI insights to exported data (JSON/CSV)
   - Create documentation for AI features
   - Optimize model parameters for specific use cases

2. **Production Database Setup**:
   - Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL
   - Set up database backup and monitoring
   - Implement connection pooling for scalability

3. **SSL/TLS Implementation**:
   - Set up HTTPS with Let's Encrypt SSL certificates
   - Configure secure headers (HSTS, CSP)
   - Implement TLS 1.2/1.3 only configuration

4. **Simple Email Server Setup**:
   - Configure standard SMTP service for TechSaaS.Tech domain
   - Set up required DNS records (MX, SPF)
   - Create system email addresses (contact@, support@, noreply@)
   - Update brand configuration to use new email accounts

5. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Finalize DNS settings for TechSaaS.Tech
   - Verify domain ownership across all services

6. **Additional Security Measures**:
   - Review and remove hardcoded credentials
   - Implement comprehensive API rate limiting
   - Set up proper error logging and monitoring
   - Configure regular security audits

## üöß Blockers
- AI16Z API authentication requires proper credential management
- PostgreSQL configuration needs to be tested in staging before production

## üìù Notes
- Domain is registered as TechSaaS.Tech
- GitHub username is 5252LLC (update all references)
- Simple email setup is replacing ProtonMail business option for easier implementation
- All templates must be responsive with mobile-first design
- Fixed SQLAlchemy DetachedInstanceError in development mode auto-login (April 26, 2025)
- Added logout button to improve user session management
- Implemented rate limiting for API endpoints
- Removed development backdoor that bypassed authentication (April 26, 2025)
- AI16Z integration will enhance web scraping with machine learning capabilities
