## Development Methodology

This project follows a structured task-driven development approach using the Task Master system:

1. **Task Generation**: Tasks are derived from PRD documents and structured into a dependency hierarchy
2. **Complexity Analysis**: Tasks are evaluated for complexity and broken down accordingly
3. **Implementation Flow**: Development proceeds according to dependency order and priority
4. **Documentation**: All components are thoroughly documented as they are developed
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing strategy is applied for each component

## Project Timeline

The development is organized into 10 primary tasks with corresponding subtasks, scheduled across multiple development phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2)
- Setup development environment and project structure
- Initialize repository and documentation framework
- Configure dependency management
- Setup Git repository and GitHub integration ([Git Setup Guide](docs/GIT_SETUP.md))

### Phase 2: Core Services (Days 3-7)
- Implement Video Scraper Flask API and wrapper
- Create Web Browser Interface
- Develop Hitomi-Downloader integration

### Phase 3: AI Integration (Days 8-12)
- Set up LangChain framework with Ollama
- Implement AI analysis capabilities
- Connect AI services to scraper components

### Phase 4: Security & API (Days 13-17)
- Implement authentication system
- Create data encryption pipeline
- Develop anonymization services
- Configure API gateway

### Phase 5: Final Integration (Days 18-21)
- Connect all components
- Optimize performance
- Finalize documentation
- Deploy to production

## Task Breakdown

The full task breakdown is managed through the Task Master system. To access the current tasks:
