# Video Scraper Development Roadmap

## Current Status (May 2, 2025)

We've stabilized the video scraper core functionality and maintained reliable extraction capabilities. After encountering integration issues with the batch URL processing features, we've reverted to the stable version to ensure reliability. Task 5 (LangChain and Ollama Integration) is now in active implementation with substantial progress on environment validation, dependency management, Ollama setup, and model download functionality.

## Project Objectives

1. Maintain a simple, reliable video extraction tool
2. Support a wide range of video platforms
3. Provide clear feedback and error handling
4. Ensure downloaded files are easily accessible
5. Add AI-powered video analysis capabilities

## Completed Items

### Core Functionality
- Reliable single URL extraction
- User-friendly error messages
- Clean and responsive UI
- Working downloads tab with file listings

## In Progress

### LangChain and Ollama Integration (Task 5)
- âœ… Task 5.1: Environment validation (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Task 5.2: Dependency installation (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Task 5.3: Platform-specific Ollama setup (COMPLETED)
  - Enhanced with dynamic version detection via GitHub API
  - Added support for official installation script
  - Implemented intelligent version management
- âœ… Task 5.4: Download required models (COMPLETED)
  - Added intelligent model discovery and verification
  - Implemented robust name matching and normalization
  - Created fallback mechanisms for unavailable models
- ðŸ”„ Task 5.5: Test LangChain and Ollama integration (PENDING)

## Short-Term Goals (Next Week)

### Priority 1: Complete LangChain and Ollama Integration
- âœ… Validate Python environment and dependencies (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Set up Ollama based on platform detection (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Download required models (llama3.2:3b, mistral:latest) (COMPLETED)
- Implement transcription and analysis features
- Test integration with the video scraper UI

### Priority 2: User Experience Improvements
- Add file size and duration information to extraction results
- Implement progress indication for large downloads
- Add sorting and filtering options for downloaded videos

### Priority 3: Search Functionality 
- Implement real search API using YouTube Data API
- Replace mock results with actual video search results
- Add pagination for search results

### Priority 4: Plan and Implement Multimodal Processing
- Integrate model loading with video and image analysis
- Create unified model manager for Ollama and HuggingFace models
- Develop video frame extraction and analysis capabilities
- Implement content summarization features

## Mid-Term Goals (1-2 Months)

### Retry Batch Processing Implementation
- Design robust batch URL processing with better error handling
- Implement clipboard paste and file upload for URL lists
- Ensure parallel processing doesn't impact core functionality

### Enhanced Video Management
- Add video metadata extraction (title, author, date)
- Implement custom naming for downloaded files
- Add basic video organization by platform/category

### Additional Platform Support
- Add support for Twitch clips and streams
- Improve Reddit video extraction
- Support for Instagram videos and reels

## Long-Term Vision (3+ Months)

### Integration with Other Services
- Connect to media servers for direct streaming
- Implement cloud storage options for downloads
- Add API for programmatic access

### Advanced Features
- Simple video trimming capability
- Add optional lightweight preview functionality
- Implement scheduled downloads

### Performance Optimizations
- Optimize download speeds with connection pooling
- Add download resumption capability
- Implement smart quality selection based on network speed

## Development Guidelines

1. **Maintain Simplicity**: Avoid feature creep that compromises stability
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Each supported platform must have comprehensive tests
3. **Error Handling**: Provide clear user feedback for all error conditions
4. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with each change

## Starting Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the server: `cd video-scraper && python api/app.py`
4. Begin with items from Priority 1 in Short-Term Goals
