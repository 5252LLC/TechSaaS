# Video Scraper Development Roadmap

## Current Status (April 30, 2025)

We have successfully rolled back complex video preview functionality while maintaining core extraction capabilities. The scraper now supports basic functionality with reliable downloads and error handling.

## Project Objectives

1. Maintain a simple, reliable video extraction tool
2. Support a wide range of video platforms
3. Provide clear feedback and error handling
4. Ensure downloaded files are easily accessible

## Short-Term Goals (Next 2 Weeks)

### Priority 1: Stability and Platform Support
- Fix remaining URL mapping issues for all supported platforms
- Add comprehensive platform detection tests
- Implement proper error recovery for network failures

### Priority 2: User Experience Improvements
- Add file size and duration information to extraction results
- Implement progress indication for large downloads
- Add sorting and filtering options for downloaded videos

### Priority 3: Search Functionality 
- Implement real search API using YouTube Data API
- Replace mock results with actual video search results
- Add pagination for search results

## Mid-Term Goals (1-2 Months)

### Enhanced Video Management

## Long-Term Vision (3+ Months)

### Integration with Other Services
- Connect to media servers for direct streaming
- Implement cloud storage options for downloads
- Add API for programmatic access

### Advanced Features

- Add download resumption capability
- Implement smart quality selection based on network speed

## Development Guidelines

1. **Maintain Simplicity**: Avoid feature creep that compromises stability
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Each supported platform must have comprehensive tests
3. **Error Handling**: Provide clear user feedback for all error conditions
4. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with each change

## Starting Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the server: `cd video-scraper && python api/app.py`
4. Begin with items from Priority 1 in Short-Term Goals
