# API Key Management with Audit Trail Integration (Task 10.11)

Date: May 4, 2025

## Overview

Today I completed the implementation of a secure API key management system with comprehensive audit trail integration for the TechSaaS platform. This system is a critical component of our API monetization strategy and security infrastructure.

## Implemented Components

1. **API Key Manager**
   - Created a secure API key management module in `/ai-service/api/v1/utils/api_key_manager.py`
   - Implemented three-part key format (prefix.id.secret) with high entropy (192 bits)
   - Added secret hashing for secure storage (never storing raw secrets)
   - Implemented tiered access levels (basic, premium, enterprise) with different rate limits
   - Added key expiration based on subscription tier
   - Implemented scope-based permissions for fine-grained access control

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Created comprehensive API endpoints in `/ai-service/api/v1/routes/api_key_endpoints.py`
   - Implemented key creation, listing, validation, and revocation
   - Added admin-only endpoints for detailed key information
   - Implemented middleware for API key usage tracking
   - Added rate limiting based on subscription tier

3. **Audit Trail Integration**
   - Added detailed audit logging for all key lifecycle events (creation, validation, revocation)
   - Implemented different sensitivity levels for security-relevant events
   - Added tracking of failed key attempts and unauthorized access
   - Integrated with our tamper-evident audit trail system

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created a comprehensive test suite in `/ai-service/tests/api_keys/test_api_key_management.py`
   - Implemented tests for all key operations
   - Added verification of audit trail entries for each operation
   - Added tests for security controls and authorization

5. **Documentation**
   - Created detailed documentation in `/docs/api/api-key-management.md`
   - Provided instructions for users of all skill levels
   - Added security best practices and implementation details
   - Documented the audit trail integration points

## Technical Implementation Details

The API key management system uses several security techniques:

1. **Secure Key Generation**
   - Keys are generated with cryptographically secure random sources
   - The three-part format (prefix.id.secret) enables easy validation and revocation
   - Secrets are never stored in plaintext, only as secure hashes

2. **Authorization Controls**
   - Users can only manage their own API keys
   - Admin endpoints are protected with explicit permission checks
   - Operations are logged with appropriate actor information

3. **Usage Tracking**
   - All API requests are tracked for billing purposes
   - Tracks endpoint, method, status code, and response time
   - Captures IP address for security monitoring

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implements tier-based rate limits (60/300/1200 requests per minute)
   - Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
   - Enforces subscription-level access controls

## Integration with Audit Trail

Every significant API key operation is logged to the audit trail with appropriate sensitivity levels:

- **API Key Creation** (SENSITIVITY_HIGH): Records the creation of new API keys
- **API Key Validation** (SENSITIVITY_MEDIUM): Tracks successful key validations
- **API Key Revocation** (SENSITIVITY_HIGH): Logs when keys are disabled
- **Failed Key Attempts** (SENSITIVITY_HIGH): Records invalid key usage
- **Unauthorized Access** (SENSITIVITY_CRITICAL): Logs unauthorized modification attempts

This creates a complete audit record for compliance with standards like SOC2 and HIPAA.

## Key File Locations

For future reference, here are the important files:
- `/ai-service/api/v1/utils/api_key_manager.py`: Core API key management functionality
- `/ai-service/api/v1/routes/api_key_endpoints.py`: API endpoints for key management
- `/ai-service/tests/api_keys/test_api_key_management.py`: Test suite
- `/docs/api/api-key-management.md`: Comprehensive documentation

## Security Considerations

The implementation ensures that:
- **Secrets are protected**: Raw API key secrets are never stored
- **Access is controlled**: Users can only manage their own keys
- **Events are logged**: All operations create tamper-evident audit records
- **Usage is tracked**: All API requests are monitored for security and billing

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Billing System**
   - Connect API usage data to the billing infrastructure
   - Implement usage-based invoicing based on tier and consumption

2. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Create a visual dashboard for API key management
   - Add usage analytics and security monitoring capabilities

3. **Move to Next Task**
   - With Task 10.11 complete, ready to move to the next task in our security roadmap
