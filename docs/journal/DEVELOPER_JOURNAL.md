- Implemented background job processing system for asynchronous video analysis
- Added memory management integration for persistent video analysis context
- Created a demo server with web UI for testing the connector
- Implemented graceful fallbacks when components are missing
- Added comprehensive test suite for the connector

#### Technical Implementation Details
- Designed a background processing system for video analysis:
  - Created `ProcessingJob` class to track job status and results
  - Implemented thread-based worker for background processing
  - Added queuing mechanism with configurable size limits
  - Designed proper locking for thread safety

- Implemented video processing pipeline:
  - Created frame extraction with configurable interval settings
  - Added integration with multimodal processor for frame analysis
  - Implemented query-based and general description processing flows
  - Added summarization of frame analyses for complete video understanding

- Added memory management integration:
  - Connected with existing LangChainService memory systems
  - Added persistent storage of video analysis results
  - Created memory-aware context for follow-up questions about videos

- Created robust error handling:
  - Implemented graceful fallbacks when components are missing
  - Added comprehensive logging throughout the system
  - Created mock data generation for demonstration and testing
  - Added proper resource cleanup for large video processing

#### Technical Challenges Resolved
- Created a resilient system that works even when some components are unavailable
- Implemented thread-safe job tracking with proper locking
- Added proper scope handling in closures to prevent UnboundLocalError
- Created realistic mock data generation for testing and demo purposes
- Designed a clean API that works with both query-based and general analysis
