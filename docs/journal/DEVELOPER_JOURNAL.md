## Git Branching Strategy

The project follows a structured branching strategy:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for feature work
- `feature/*`: Individual feature branches
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes for production

## Development Journal Entries

### Day 1: April 30, 2025 - Project Setup and Planning

#### Tasks Completed
- Set up development environment
- Initialized Task Master for project management
- Created roadmap and documentation structure
- Generated initial tasks from PRD

#### Git Activity
```bash
# Repository initialization
git init
git add README.md PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/525277x/techsaas-platform.git
git push -u origin main

# Created develop branch
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop
```

#### Technical Decisions
- Selected Task Master for project management to follow structured development
- Adopted a microservices architecture with Flask for service implementations
- Chose LangChain + Ollama for AI implementation over the previous AI16z approach

#### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding project structure organization
- Setting up Task Master for project management
- Creating comprehensive documentation templates

#### Next Steps
- Implement basic directory structure
- Install core dependencies
- Complete first task: "Setup Development Environment and Project Structure"

### Day 2: [DATE TBD] - Environment Setup and Core Structure

#### Planned Tasks
- Create directory structure following the architecture diagram
- Set up virtual environment and install dependencies
- Configure initial Flask applications for each service
- Implement basic security patterns

#### Implementation Details
[To be completed after implementation]

#### Git Activity
```bash
# Create feature branch for environment setup
git checkout -b feature/environment-setup
# Commits will be added during implementation
```

[Additional journal entries will be added as development progresses]

## Issue Tracking

All development work is tracked through GitHub Issues and managed with Task Master. The mapping between Task Master tasks and GitHub issues is maintained in `tasks/issue_mapping.json`.

## Documentation Progress

| Documentation Type | Status | Target Audience | Description |
|-------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| API Reference | Not Started | Technical Developers | Comprehensive API documentation |
| Tutorials | Not Started | New Coders | Step-by-step implementation guides |
| Architecture Diagrams | In Progress | All Levels | Visual representation of system design |
| User Guides | Not Started | End Users | How to use the platform |

## Performance Tracking

Performance metrics are tracked and recorded here to ensure the system meets requirements:

| Component | Metric | Target | Current | Last Updated |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Video Scraper | Response Time | <500ms | TBD | N/A |
| API Gateway | Requests/second | >100 | TBD | N/A |
| Web Browser | Page Load Time | <1s | TBD | N/A |

## Security Audit Log

Security audit information will be maintained here to track potential issues and their resolution:

| Date | Component | Issue | Resolution | Severity |
|------|-----------|-------|------------|----------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

[Additional security audit entries will be added as development progresses]

## Deployment History

| Version | Date | Environment | Notes |
|---------|------|------------|-------|
| 0.1.0 | TBD | Development | Initial setup |

[Additional deployment entries will be added as development progresses]
