# TechSaaS Platform: Task Master Development Journal

This journal specifically tracks the progress through Task Master-managed tasks, providing detailed information about implementation decisions, challenges, and solutions for each task.

## Task Master Workflow Overview

The TechSaaS project follows the structured development workflow defined in the DEV_WORKFLOW process:

1. **Task List Review**: Begin coding sessions with `task-master list` to see current tasks, status, and IDs
2. **Complexity Analysis**: Analyze task complexity with `task-master analyze-complexity --research` before breaking down tasks
3. **Task Selection**: Select tasks based on dependencies (all marked 'done'), priority level, and ID order
4. **Task Clarification**: Check task files in tasks/ directory or ask for user input
5. **Task Details**: View specific task details using `task-master show <id>` to understand implementation requirements
6. **Task Breakdown**: Break down complex tasks using `task-master expand --id=<id>` with appropriate flags
7. **Implementation**: Code following task details, dependencies, and project standards
8. **Task Verification**: Verify tasks according to test strategies before marking as complete
9. **Task Completion**: Mark completed tasks with `task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=done`
10. **Dependency Updates**: Update dependent tasks when implementation differs from original plan

## Task Implementation Journal

### Task #1: Setup Development Environment and Project Structure

**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Complexity Score**: 3 (Low)  
**GitHub Issue**: [#1 - Setup Development Environment](https://github.com/525277x/techsaas-platform/issues/1)

#### Task Analysis
This foundational task involves creating the basic project structure, installing dependencies, and setting up the development environment. The task has a low complexity score (3) as determined by the Task Master complexity analysis, indicating it's relatively straightforward.

#### Implementation Plan
1. Create the directory structure according to the architectural design
2. Set up virtual environment
3. Install core dependencies
4. Configure Node.js environment
5. Initialize Git repository

## Task Master Command Reference

For easy reference, here are the key Task Master commands used throughout development:

```bash
# List all tasks and their status
task-master list

# Show the next task to work on
task-master next

# View detailed information about a specific task
task-master show <id>

# Analyze the complexity of tasks
task-master analyze-complexity --research

# Break down a complex task into subtasks
task-master expand --id=<id> --subtasks=<number>

# Add research context to task expansion
task-master expand --id=<id> --research

# Clear existing subtasks if needed
task-master clear-subtasks --id=<id>

# Set the status of a task
task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=<status>

# Generate task files
task-master generate

# Update tasks when implementation changes
task-master update --from=<futureTaskId> --prompt="<explanation>"
```

## Task Dependencies Graph

```
Task #1 ──┬─→ Task #2 ───→ Task #4 ───→ Task #6
          │
          └─→ Task #3 ───→ Task #5 ───→ Task #7
                               │
                               └─────→ Task #8 ─→ Task #9 ─→ Task #10
```

This graph will be updated as tasks are expanded and dependencies change.

## Complexity Distribution

Based on the Task Master complexity analysis:

- **Low Complexity (1-4)**: 1 task
- **Medium Complexity (5-7)**: 6 tasks
- **High Complexity (8-10)**: 3 tasks

The most complex tasks are:
1. Task #10 - Security Layer Implementation (Complexity: 9)
2. Task #7 - LangChain and Ollama Integration (Complexity: 8)
3. Task #5 - Web Browser Interface (Complexity: 8)

These tasks will require careful planning and breakdown into manageable subtasks.
