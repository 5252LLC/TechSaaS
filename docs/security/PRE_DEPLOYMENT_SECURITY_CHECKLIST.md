# TechSaaS Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

## Critical Security Checks Before Production Launch

Before deploying the TechSaaS platform to production environments, we must complete the following security checks to ensure no sensitive data or credentials are exposed through our public repositories or deployment processes.

### 1. Repository Security Audit

- [ ] Run GitLeaks or TruffleHog against all repositories to scan git history for credentials
- [ ] Verify all configuration examples use placeholder values, not real credentials
- [ ] Check documentation files (especially .md files) for sensitive information
- [ ] Review JWT authentication configuration for security best practices
- [ ] Ensure all API key references are properly sanitized in example code

### 2. Credential Management Improvements

- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental credential commits
- [ ] Set up a proper secrets management solution (HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager)
- [ ] Move all hardcoded configuration to environment variables or config files
- [ ] Document proper credential rotation procedures
- [ ] Segregate production credentials from development environments

### 3. External Security Measures

- [ ] Perform a thorough content security audit of all public-facing documentation
- [ ] Review all OAuth integration configurations for security issues
- [ ] Scan deployed web interfaces for client-side security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify payment processing systems follow PCI-DSS requirements
- [ ] Check external API integrations for proper credential handling

### 4. Security Policy Documentation

- [ ] Create comprehensive SECURITY.md for both repositories
- [ ] Document security incident reporting procedures
- [ ] Add contributor guidelines regarding sensitive data handling
- [ ] Create security training materials for new team members
- [ ] Document the proper use of the PII masking system

This checklist must be completed and verified before the TechSaaS platform is deployed to production. Each item should be reviewed by at least two team members to ensure thorough validation.
