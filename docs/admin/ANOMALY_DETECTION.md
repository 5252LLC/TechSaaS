# TechSaaS Anomaly Detection System

## Overview

The TechSaaS Anomaly Detection System is a comprehensive security feature that continuously monitors platform activity to identify potential security threats, unusual behavior patterns, and compliance violations. This system enhances the platform's security posture by providing early detection of suspicious activities and automated responses to potential threats.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Continuous monitoring of user activity, API usage, and system interactions
- **Behavior Baseline Establishment**: Learning normal usage patterns to identify deviations
- **Multiple Detection Types**: Various detection algorithms for different types of anomalies
- **Automated Response Actions**: Configurable responses to detected threats
- **Security Dashboard**: Administrative interface for reviewing and managing detected anomalies
- **Compliance Integration**: Seamless integration with the compliance audit system

## Getting Started

### For Beginners

If you're new to security monitoring and anomaly detection, here's a simple overview of how the system works:

1. The system monitors activity across the TechSaaS platform
2. It establishes what "normal" behavior looks like for each user and IP address
3. When something unusual happens (like logging in at 3 AM when a user never does that), it raises an alert
4. Administrators can view and respond to these alerts from the security dashboard

To view the anomaly detection dashboard:

```
1. Log in as an administrator
2. Navigate to Administration > Security > Anomaly Detection
3. The dashboard will show recent anomalies and statistics
```

### For Experienced Developers

If you're integrating with the anomaly detection system or extending its functionality, here are the key components:

```python
# Initialize the anomaly manager with custom detectors
from api.v1.utils.anomaly_detection import AnomalyManager
from api.v1.utils.anomaly_detectors import AccessTimeAnomalyDetector

# Create and configure the manager
manager = AnomalyManager()
manager.register_detector(AccessTimeAnomalyDetector())

# Analyze an event for anomalies
event_data = {
    "timestamp": "2025-05-04T14:30:00Z",
    "user_id": "user123",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "endpoint": "/api/v1/sensitive-data"
}
anomalies = manager.analyze_event(event_data)

# Process detected anomalies
for anomaly in anomalies:
    print(f"Detected {anomaly.anomaly_type.value} with {anomaly.severity.value} severity")
```

The system uses a middleware approach to intercept API requests and analyze them for anomalies. To add your own detector, extend the `AnomalyDetector` base class:

```python
from api.v1.utils.anomaly_detection import AnomalyDetector, AnomalyType, AnomalySeverity

class MyCustomDetector(AnomalyDetector):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("my_custom_detector", AnomalyType.CUSTOM)
        
    def train(self, training_data):
        # Establish baseline using training data
        self.baseline_established = True
        return True
        
    def detect(self, event_data):
        # Your detection logic here
        if unusual_condition:
            return create_anomaly_event(...)
        return None
```

## Technical Reference

### Detection Types

The system includes the following anomaly detection algorithms:

| Detector Type | Description | Response Actions |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Access Time | Detects access during unusual hours for a user | Log, Notify, Require MFA |
| Geographic Location | Identifies accesses from unusual locations or impossible travel | Log, Notify, Require MFA, Revoke Session |
| Request Frequency | Detects abnormally high API request rates | Log, Notify, Rate Limit, Block IP |
| Authentication Failures | Identifies potential brute force or credential stuffing attacks | Log, Notify, Lock Account, Block IP |

### Architecture

The anomaly detection system consists of these core components:

1. **Anomaly Manager** (`AnomalyManager`): Central coordinator that manages detectors and handles anomaly storage
2. **Anomaly Detectors** (subclasses of `AnomalyDetector`): Specific algorithms for detecting different types of anomalies
3. **Response Handler** (`ResponseHandler`): Executes response actions when anomalies are detected
4. **Middleware** (`AnomalyDetectionMiddleware`): Intercepts API requests and routes them to the anomaly detection system
5. **API Routes** (`anomaly_blueprint`): Provides REST endpoints for managing the system and retrieving anomaly data
6. **Admin Dashboard**: Frontend interface for security analysts to review and respond to anomalies

### API Reference

#### Anomaly Management Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/security/anomalies` | GET | List detected anomalies with optional filtering |
| `/api/v1/security/anomalies/{id}` | GET | Get details for a specific anomaly |
| `/api/v1/security/anomalies/{id}/status` | PUT | Update the status of an anomaly |
| `/api/v1/security/anomalies/dashboard` | GET | Get aggregated data for the anomaly dashboard |
| `/api/v1/security/anomalies/cleanup` | POST | Remove old anomaly records |
| `/api/v1/security/settings` | GET | Get current detector settings |
| `/api/v1/security/settings` | PUT | Update detector settings |
| `/api/v1/security/train` | POST | Train anomaly detectors with historical data |

#### Security Dashboard

The security anomaly dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for:

- Viewing high-level statistics on detected anomalies
- Monitoring trends in anomaly detection
- Reviewing individual anomalies with detailed information
- Updating anomaly status (new, under review, resolved, false positive)
- Adding review comments for team collaboration
- Filtering anomalies by various criteria

## Administrator Guide

### Initial Configuration

The anomaly detection system requires initial training to establish baseline behavior patterns. By default, this is done automatically using historical data when the system is first activated. To manually train or retrain the system:

1. Navigate to Administration > Security > Anomaly Detection
2. Click "Settings" in the top right
3. In the settings panel, click "Train Detectors"
4. Select the detectors to train and click "Start Training"

### Responding to Anomalies

When an anomaly is detected, security administrators should:

1. Review the anomaly details, including type, severity, and context
2. Investigate using the provided data to determine if it's a genuine security concern
3. Update the anomaly status:
   - "Under Review" while investigating
   - "Resolved" if addressed and confirmed as a genuine threat
   - "False Positive" if determined not to be a security concern
4. Add comments explaining the investigation and resolution

### Tuning the System

To reduce false positives or adjust detection sensitivity:

1. Navigate to Administration > Security > Anomaly Detection > Settings
2. Adjust thresholds for specific detectors based on your environment
3. Enable or disable specific detectors as needed
4. Configure automated response actions based on your security policies

## Compliance Integration

The anomaly detection system integrates with the TechSaaS compliance framework to support:

- **GDPR compliance**: Monitoring for unauthorized access to personal data
- **HIPAA compliance**: Tracking access to protected health information
- **SOC2 compliance**: Supporting security monitoring requirements
- **PCI-DSS compliance**: Detecting potential breaches of cardholder data

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Review**: Establish a routine for reviewing detected anomalies
2. **Training Updates**: Retrain detectors periodically as usage patterns evolve
3. **Response Testing**: Regularly test automated response actions to ensure effectiveness
4. **Dashboard Monitoring**: Use the dashboard to identify trends and potential security issues
5. **Integration**: Connect anomaly detection with incident response procedures
6. **Documentation**: Maintain records of investigated anomalies for compliance purposes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: High rate of false positives
**Solution**: Retrain the detectors with more historical data or adjust thresholds in settings

**Issue**: No anomalies being detected
**Solution**: Verify that the middleware is properly initialized and that detectors are enabled

**Issue**: Dashboard not showing data
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors and verify API connectivity

### Logging

The anomaly detection system logs its activities to:

- Application logs: `/var/log/techsaas/anomaly-detection.log`
- Audit trail: Searchable through the admin interface
- Storage: Raw anomaly data is stored in `data/anomalies/` directory
