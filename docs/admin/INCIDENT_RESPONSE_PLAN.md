## 8. Integration with Anomaly Detection System

The TechSaaS Anomaly Detection System provides automated detection of potential security incidents, which integrates with this Incident Response Plan as follows:

### 8.1 Automated Detection

The Anomaly Detection System identifies the following types of anomalies:

- **Access Time Anomalies**: Unusual login times compared to user baseline
- **Geographic Location Anomalies**: Logins from unusual locations or impossible travel scenarios
- **Request Frequency Anomalies**: Unusual patterns or volumes of API requests
- **Authentication Anomalies**: Multiple failed login attempts or credential stuffing attacks

### 8.2 Response Workflow

1. **Alert Generation**:
   - Anomaly Detection System generates an alert
   - Alert is logged in the security event management system
   - Notification is sent to on-call personnel based on severity

2. **Initial Triage**:
   - Security Analyst reviews the alert details
   - Correlates with other security events
   - Determines if the alert represents a genuine incident
   - Classifies the severity and type

3. **Response Activation**:
   - For genuine incidents, creates an incident record
   - Initiates the appropriate response workflow
   - Begins investigation and containment procedures

### 8.3 Continuous Improvement

- Feedback loop between incident findings and anomaly detection
- Regular tuning of detection thresholds based on false positives/negatives
- Addition of new detection patterns based on incident analysis
- Periodic review of alert effectiveness
