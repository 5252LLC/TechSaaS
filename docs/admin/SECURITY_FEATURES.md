# TechSaaS Security Features

This document outlines the security features available in the TechSaaS platform.

## Core Security Components

The TechSaaS platform includes the following core security components:

1. [Authentication and Authorization](#authentication-and-authorization)
2. [API Key Management](#api-key-management)
3. [Audit Trail](#audit-trail)
4. [Anomaly Detection](#anomaly-detection)
5. [Incident Response System](#incident-response-system)
6. [Security Compliance](#security-compliance)

## Authentication and Authorization

The TechSaaS platform uses a robust authentication and authorization system to ensure that only authorized users can access the platform and its features.

- **Authentication Methods**:
  - Username and password with strong password policies
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  - OAuth2 integration for single sign-on (SSO)

- **Authorization Framework**:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Fine-grained permission system
  - API scopes for controlled API access

## API Key Management

The API key management system allows for secure access to TechSaaS APIs:

- Secure API key generation with high-entropy secrets
- Tiered access levels (basic, premium, enterprise)
- Scope-based permissions
- Audit trail integration for all key lifecycle events
- Comprehensive key validation and authorization

See [API_KEY_MANAGEMENT.md](./API_KEY_MANAGEMENT.md) for details.

## Audit Trail

The audit trail system records all security-relevant actions in the platform:

- Detailed logging of security events
- Tamper-evident audit records with hash chaining
- Compliance with regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA)
- Searchable audit records for investigation

## Anomaly Detection

The anomaly detection system monitors for suspicious activities:

- Real-time monitoring of user behavior
- Detection of unusual access patterns
- Alerting for potential security threats
- Integration with incident response for automatic incident creation

See [ANOMALY_DETECTION.md](./ANOMALY_DETECTION.md) for details.

## Incident Response System

The incident response system provides comprehensive tools for managing security incidents:

- Complete incident lifecycle management
- Integration with anomaly detection for automatic incident creation
- Incident dashboard for security team monitoring
- Timeline tracking for incident activities
- Evidence collection and management
- Containment action tracking
- Detailed reporting for post-incident analysis

The incident response system is designed based on industry best practices and aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

For detailed information, see [INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN.md](./INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN.md).

### Incident Dashboard

The incident dashboard provides a centralized interface for security teams to manage incidents:

- Real-time view of all security incidents
- Filtering and searching capabilities
- Detailed incident information
- Timeline visualization
- Evidence management
- Action tracking
- Integration with notification systems for alerts
- Reporting and analytics

### API Endpoints

The incident response system exposes the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/security/incidents` - List all incidents with filtering options
- `POST /api/v1/security/incidents` - Create a new incident
- `GET /api/v1/security/incidents/{incident_id}` - Get details for a specific incident
- `PATCH /api/v1/security/incidents/{incident_id}` - Update incident details
- `POST /api/v1/security/incidents/{incident_id}/events` - Add a timeline event
- `POST /api/v1/security/incidents/{incident_id}/containment` - Add a containment action
- `PATCH /api/v1/security/incidents/{incident_id}/containment/{action_id}` - Update containment action
- `POST /api/v1/security/incidents/{incident_id}/evidence` - Add evidence
- `GET /api/v1/security/incidents/stats` - Get incident statistics

## Security Compliance

The TechSaaS platform is designed to comply with various security standards and regulations:

- GDPR compliance for data protection
- SOC2 compliance for service organizations
- HIPAA compliance for healthcare data
- PCI DSS compliance for payment data

Regular security assessments and audits are conducted to ensure ongoing compliance.
