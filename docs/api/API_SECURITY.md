# TechSaaS API Security Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidelines and best practices for securely interacting with the TechSaaS API. Our authentication system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and includes role-based and tier-based access controls.

## Authentication

### Authentication Process

To authenticate with the TechSaaS API, you need to obtain a JWT token through our secure authentication endpoints. For detailed implementation examples and code samples, please refer to the secure developer portal after registration.

Authentication tokens are used to:
- Authorize access to protected resources
- Verify user identity and permissions
- Maintain secure sessions without storing credentials

### Using Your JWT Token

Once authenticated, include your token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Token Management

- Store tokens securely in your application
- Never expose tokens in URLs or client-side storage
- Implement proper token refresh mechanisms
- Handle token expiration gracefully

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access

The API implements role-based access control:
- Different roles have different levels of access
- Actions are permitted based on assigned roles
- Permission checks are enforced on all protected endpoints

### Subscription Tier Access

Resource access is also controlled by subscription tier:
- API rate limits vary by tier
- Feature availability depends on subscription level
- Usage quotas are enforced at the API level

## Security Best Practices

1. **Secure Communication**
   - Always use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Validate SSL certificates
   - Do not disable SSL verification in production

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement appropriate error handling
   - Do not expose error handling details to end users
   - Follow security best practices for handling authentication errors

3. **Secure Storage**
   - Store credentials and tokens securely
   - Use environment variables for sensitive information
   - Implement secure credential management

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify credentials are correct
   - Ensure tokens havenâ€™t expired
   - Check that proper authentication headers are included

2. **Authorization Errors**
   - Verify user has appropriate permissions
   - Check subscription tier meets the requirement
   - Ensure token contains necessary claims
