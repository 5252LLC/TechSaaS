# Dependencies: 3, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the security layer and API gateway to integrate all components of the TechSaaS platform.
# Details:
Implement authentication, encryption, and anonymization features as outlined in the architecture. Create an API gateway to route requests to the appropriate services. Configure the gateway to run on port 5000 as specified. Implement proper request validation, error handling, and logging. Ensure all components can communicate securely through the gateway.
