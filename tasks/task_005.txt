# Task ID: 5
# Title: Set Up LangChain and Ollama
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure the AI service with LangChain framework and Ollama integration.
# Details:
Implement the setup.py script as specified in the PRD. Create functions to check Python version, install dependencies, set up Ollama based on platform, pull required models (llama3.2:3b, grok:3b), and create necessary directories. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback throughout the setup process.

# Test Strategy:
Run the setup script and verify all components install correctly. Confirm Ollama is running and the specified models are available. Test basic model inference to ensure the setup is functional.
