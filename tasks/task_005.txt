# Task ID: 5
# Title: Set Up LangChain and Ollama
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure the AI service with LangChain framework and Ollama integration.
# Details:
Implement the setup.py script as specified in the PRD. Create functions to check Python version, install dependencies, set up Ollama based on platform, pull required models (llama3.2:3b, grok:3b), and create necessary directories. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback throughout the setup process.

# Test Strategy:
Run the setup script and verify all components install correctly. Confirm Ollama is running and the specified models are available. Test basic model inference to ensure the setup is functional.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Validate Python environment [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Check the Python version and ensure it meets the minimum requirements.
### Details:
- Check that Python version is 3.7 or higher
- Provide clear error message if Python version is unsupported
- Exit setup process if Python version check fails
- Test by running setup script with different Python versions

## 2. Install dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Install the required Python packages and dependencies.
### Details:
- Read dependencies from requirements.txt file
- Install each dependency using pip
- Handle potential installation errors and provide feedback
- Verify installations by importing key packages
- Test dependency installation by running setup script on clean environment

## 3. Platform-specific Ollama setup [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Set up Ollama based on the detected operating system.
### Details:
- Detect the operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Follow platform-specific setup steps for Ollama
- Download and install Ollama binaries/packages
- Set necessary environment variables
- Test Ollama setup by running simple Ollama command

## 4. Download required models [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Pull the required models for LangChain and Ollama integration.
### Details:
- Create directories for storing models (llama3.2:3b, grok:3b)
- Download model files from specified sources
- Verify checksums of downloaded model files
- Handle download errors and provide retry mechanism
- Test model downloads by checking file presence and sizes

## 5. Test LangChain and Ollama integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Verify the setup by running a test script that uses LangChain with Ollama.
### Details:
- Create a test script that imports LangChain and Ollama
- Initialize Ollama models and run a simple query
- Verify the output and check for any errors
- Provide clear success/failure messages based on test results
- Include the test script in the setup process
- Test the integration with different models and queries
