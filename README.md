### Task Management

For managing tasks, use the Task Master command-line tool:

```
# List all tasks and their status
./task-master.sh list

# View details of a specific task
./task-master.sh show <task-id>

# Mark a task as in progress
./task-master.sh set-status --id=<task-id> --status=in-progress

# Mark a task as complete
./task-master.sh set-status --id=<task-id> --status=done
```

## Security Features

TechSaaS implements robust security features to protect both the platform and its users:

- **Tiered Access Control**: Access to features and resources is managed through subscription tiers
- **API Authentication**: All API endpoints are secured with authentication
- **Environment-Specific Security**: Different security profiles for development, testing, and production
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through tier-specific rate limits
- **Admin Access Controls**: Secure administration interfaces with strong authentication
- **Documentation Security**: Sensitive implementation details restricted to authenticated access

### Development vs Production Security

The platform uses different security profiles based on environment:

- **Development**: Streamlined authentication for easier testing and development
- **Production**: Full security enforcement with strict authentication requirements

For development setup information, please refer to the enclosed documentation.
